And Cursor For Those Who Do Know They’re Publishers, but need to build context, warrant attention, and use culture not only to bring people to your books, but motivate people to tell other people to read your books, that is, to be a great brand, even if you don’t like the word.

For that Cursor, if you’re a non-U.S. publisher, you may wish to avail of a program (or programme, as you might write), we’ve develop to support English-langauge publishers based outside the U.S. to obtain marketing support across your entire list. We go beyond the traditional approach to book P.R. by stimulating each title’s position within the networks of culture and opinion in the U.S.
